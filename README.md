## About Deewar

Deewar is a powerful API gateway designed to streamline client-service interactions within a microservices architecture. It serves as the single entry point for client requests, receiving each one, identifying the appropriate microservice, and efficiently routing the request to the intended service. Once the microservice processes the request, Deewar forwards the response back to the client, ensuring a seamless, fast, and secure exchange. Additionally, Deewar manages essential session and cookie handling, providing stateful support for client sessions without burdening individual microservices. This allows Deewar to enhance security, simplify service discovery, and offer a smoother, more consistent user experience by centralizing these tasks at the gateway level.
